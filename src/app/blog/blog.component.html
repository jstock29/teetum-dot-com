    <h3>Keeping Up: Spooky Glam</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    It's me! Teetum! Yes, it's my birthday and has been for weeks. If you've been
    following my Insta stories AT ALL you should know that the theme this year's party
    is <em>"Spooky Glam,"</em> although some people have taken to calling it
    <em>"Glam Neglect."</em> Obviously they're wrong and will be thrown out of my
    party Survivor-style if I can find them through all of these bedazzled cobwebs.
  </p>
  <p>New York is always so spoopy in the Fall, and there's something about all the
    little Teetums contemplating death that makes me really want to light all
    50 of my Trader Joe's candles at once and pump some Britney. It really makes me thankful to not be dead!
  </p>

    To prepare for tonight, I went through my usual morning routine of running 12 miles to
    a spin class with bottomless mimosas, so as you can imagine, I'm just about ready for a 4Loko right now!
    In addition to 4Loko, I've set out all of my favorite spoopy snacks, which include and are limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Celery</li>
    <li>Hummus</li>
    <li>Pita Chips</li>
    <li>Red Wine</li>
    <li>Veggie Sausages</li>
    <li>White Claw #ad</li>
    <li>Sweetgreen #spon</li>
    <li>Beef Chili</li>
    <li>Vodka Water</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Just Salt</li>
    <li>Kale</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks to my amazing Teetum (Annie) for the incredible cake which she <em>actually made</em>
    and only cut <em>after I gave her permission</em>. It was so delicious and I'm not at all throwing up!</p>
  <p>This night will be the best time any of us have ever had! Let me know all about your spoopy night on TikTok!</p>
  <p>xoxo,</p>
  <br />
  <p>Teetum!</p>
